### Short Description
On the image above we can see the Compstat 2.0 Website. On the left of the website in the **CompStat Book** 
section it can be specified what data-points should be shown on the **Incident Map** in the middle. (In the 
image above I selected the **<u>Total</u>** Number of Crimes that Happened in the **<u>Week to Date</u>** 
**<u>2022</u>** from 06/13/2022 - 06/19/2022). With each point there is are relational x and y coordiantes 
as well as, a specific and broad cime label and the time of the occurence of the crime.

### Objective
- first specify a category and time frame of crimes that should be displayed on the map
- loop through all points on the map to get the time, location, and specific/broad crime label
